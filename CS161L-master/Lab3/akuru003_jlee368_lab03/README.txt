REMARKS
- My module works as described in the specification. I have two combinatorial logics that set 
the appropriate registers. 
==========================================================

BUGS IF ANY 
- There are no known bugs as the test cases I RAN all came out fine. I do not know for sure what the values should have been so I cannot say whether my lab is 100% correct.
