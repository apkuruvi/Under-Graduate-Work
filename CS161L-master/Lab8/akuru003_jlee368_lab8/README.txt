REMARKS
- I modified the test bench you gave us because I needed a clock and a reset. I also added more time in between test cases (#300). 
 My module is a bit incomplete for signed add, but it is working for most of the test cases (15 of the 22). 
==========================================================

BUGS IF ANY 
- My module works for all the UNSIGNED sub test cases. It only fails on ONE UNSIGNED ADD test case. It also fails on two signed sub cases. It fails four signed add cases. It works for everything else.
