REMARKS
- My module works as described in the specification. However, we made a few changes in the files that our cs161_processor.v only works with our copy files.
In order to test our lab, you need to "Add Copy of Source" instead of "Add Source" because only doing "Add Source" messes up our lab output.
==========================================================

BUGS IF ANY 
- There are no known bugs as the test cases I RAN the lab and it looks the same as the lab spec
