REMARKS
- I cannot be sure my lab works 100% because I can't confirm that every value I got is right. I believe my lab works for the most part. I used the code we were given in the tar as well as the cs 161l lab 6 page that had the sample BCAM/TCAM/STCAM vhdl code for naming variables. 
==========================================================

BUGS IF ANY 
- There are no KNOWN bugs as the test cases I ran look fine.

ORIGINAL WORK STATEMENT
- I certify that this submission represents my own original work. This submission was not done in collaboration nor was any substanial portion of the code obtained from third parties, including websites and the like.
